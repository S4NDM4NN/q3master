# Quake 3 Engine Server Browser

A standalone Go-based real-time server browser for Quake III Arena engine games. This tool discovers, polls, and displays active game servers for **Return to Castle Wolfenstein (RTCW)** and **Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory (ET)** via a Bootstrap-powered frontend.

Live Server Viewer: [list.s4ndmod.com](https://list.s4ndmod.com)

## Adding Your Server to the List

To send direct heartbeats and keep your server visible even if the official master is down, add the following to your server configuration:

```
set sv_master5 wolfmaster.s4ndmod.com
```
---

## Features

* **Master Server Polling** â€“ Queries the official master server (`wolfmaster.idsoftware.com`) every 5 minutes for active servers.
* **Built-in Master UDP** â€“ Serves Quake 3 `getservers` requests and accepts `heartbeat` messages on UDP port 27950.
* **Direct Heartbeat Integration** â€“ Combines official master results with servers sending direct heartbeats to the s4ndmod master (`wolfmaster.s4ndmod.com`).
* **Resilient Listing** â€“ Servers sending direct heartbeats remain visible if the official master goes offline.
* **Broadcast Icon Indicator** â€“ Servers sending direct heartbeats are marked with a broadcast icon next to their online status.
* **Smart Poller** â€“ Continuously polls servers for real-time status updates.
* **Web API** â€“ Exposes a `/api/servers` endpoint for consuming live server data.
* **Bootstrap Frontend** â€“ Dark-themed interface with filtering, status indicators, player lists, and colorized nicknames.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Go 1.23+
* Docker (optional, for containerized builds)

---

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s4ndm4nn/q3master.git
cd q3master
go build -o q3master ./cmd/q3master
./q3master
```

The app will start polling servers and launch the web viewer at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

### Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t q3master .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 27950:27950/udp q3master
```

---

## API

### `GET /api/servers`

Returns a JSON array of all discovered game servers.

Each object includes:

* `address`: IP and port
* `hostname`: Server name (Q3 color codes supported)
* `map`: Current map
* `mod`: Mod name (e.g., shrubet, omod)
* `gametype`: Gametype string
* `version`: Server version
* `pb`: PunkBuster status
* `player_count`: Number of real players
* `players[]`: Array of real player names
* `bot_count`: Number of bots
* `bots[]`: Array of bot names
* `last_seen`: Timestamp of last successful poll
* `online`: Boolean status
* `protocol`: Integer protocol version (57/60/84)

---

## Master UDP

* Listens on UDP `:27950` and responds to `getservers <protocol> ...` with `getserversResponse` containing known servers (merged from official master and direct heartbeats).
* Accepts `heartbeat` from game servers (adds/refreshes entry) and `shutdown` (removes entry).
* Heartbeat-sourced servers are polled immediately to enrich info and determine protocol.

---

## Web Viewer

The frontend is served at `/`. It includes:

* Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
* Filter/search by name, mod, map, IP, version
* Q3 colored player and bot lists
* Protocol filter tabs
* Click-to-copy IP
* ðŸŸ¢/ðŸ”´ Status indicators with "last seen" info
* Broadcast icon next to servers sending direct heartbeats
